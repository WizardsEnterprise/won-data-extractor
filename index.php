								Many have asked why I feel I should run now while I still will have one year left on the term of my council seat. First of all let me say, I enjoy serving on council
								very much, in the past few years we have made great progress on our City. I have listened to many citizens concerns and feel I have made fair decisions. If
								I am not elected, I will wholeheartedly continue as council member.

						<p>The Minnesota House of Representatives seat for Shakopee and the Townships is too important to leave up to chance. Shakopee and the Townships deserve someone in St. Paul that they know and trust, a person who knows the various forces and needs of the community and has served them well. I am that person. I am clear about this decision and how it would affect my family and the City of Shakopee and I hope to serve you in a new role as State Representative.</p>
